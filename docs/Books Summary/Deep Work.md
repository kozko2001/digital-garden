There is a new economy knowledge workers
1. **high skilled workers** -> fast learners
2. **superstar** -> people who master a single skill -> specialists
3. **owners** -> 💰

To master or learn fast, you need to focus. 

**Attention residue**: when switching tasks -> how much your mind is still thinking in the old task -> We should minimize it

Different ways to practices deep work

1. Monastic: get a long chunk of time (say 1 week or 1 month) and divide it in two, the first half you do your normal shallow work, the second half you just *disappears* and you do the best possible work during this time frame
2. Rhythmic: you try to make an habit of deep work with daily goals, for example every day write 100 words of your novel. 
3. Journalist: Try to use any idle time to do deep work... be prepared for it.

#### Ritualize it
If you want to make an habit you have to think when and what are you going to do. if not, you are basicly just day-dreaming.
- Where and When you will work?
- How you'll work
- What are you going to do?

#### Execute like a business

- **Focus on the wildly important**: know what is the outcome of your work
- **Act on lead measures**: for tracking of your progress, use leading metrics -> they gonna affect the goal -> you can control them
- **Keep a compelling scorecard**: keep track of the hours in focus on the full year, day by day. find patterns etc...
- **Create a cadence of accountability**: create like a "retro" for yourself, where every x amount of time you review your goal and how are you doing

#### Take care of you 🧠

- don't get addicted to distractions, be like an athlete -> don't eat chocolate cause there is a bigger goal.
	- if you are waiting for the bus, don't  use your phone. -> be with your thoughts -> will help with your concentration
- get a deep piece of work, estimate it -> commit to a much less time -> this way you will have to cut some shallow work to do it.


##### Quit social media
- choose your tools carefully, as a craftsmanship would do... -> balance pros and cons of each social network
- put more thought in your leisure time -> plan what to do with your free time -> if you don't do that, then you will do whatever is easier and entertain you -> social network etc..

#### Drain the shallow

- 37 signal, did an experiment  of 30 hours of work time. most of the work was still done
	- How?  people trait time more carefully , meetings not really important were canceled
	- restrictions of time -> will remove shallow work]
- Threat shallow work as suspicious
	- is understimated the damage?
	- or the importance is overstimated

- Schedule every minute of your day
	- try to estimate how much time will take every task in your day
	- understand your biases about time taken by shallow work
	- treat time with respect

- Quantify How deep is need for a task?
	- most tasks seems important, but if you look closer, most of them are shallow work
	- rule of thumb. How much time will take for a new person to be able to do that task?

- Ask your boss for shallow work budget
	- Have a conversation about how much shallow work you are doing
	- You boss should be inclined to let you do more deep work
	- at the end is were you add more value
