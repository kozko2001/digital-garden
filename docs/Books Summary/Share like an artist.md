# Share like an artist

## Chapter 0

* An alternative to self promoting, showing your work so other can steal from it
* Paradigm shift, no more making amazing things in secrecy
* Now share what you are doing and use the networks for gather feedback, know people even patronize your work

## Chapter 1

* Lonely genius vs scenius (a scene of people with common interests )
  * Start thinking what we can do for others
  * Connect with an raceme is easier than never. The internet is a bunch os scenes
  * We are afraid of being revealed as an amateur. But it's actually good cause you have little to lose and willing to share the results
    * In the beginners mind there are many possibilities, in the experts mind there are few
  * You can go from mediacre to good with increments, the real gap is from doing nothing to something
  * The world's is changing so fast thatis turning all of us into amateurs
  * The best way to start sharing is to think something you want to learn and make a commitment in front of others
  * If your work is not online, it doesn't exist

## chapter 2

* Artist can share two kinds of experience, the final art piece, and the process to get to the art piece
  * Traditionally artists hide the process part
  * Vulnerability feeling of sharing your process
* **Become a documentarian of your work**

## chapter 3

* Share a little each day
  * Block sometime, reflect on what you did today and share
  * Don't share anything,
    * Share like if everybody could fire you
    * Is it interesting? Is it useful?
    * If not sure, better o save it for later
  * Stock and flow
    * Stock is content that is as useful today that in 2 years, is content audience search for it
    * Flow is the stream of daily content
    * Create a balance between both, patterns will emerge from your flow, you can organize them to create stock

## chapter 4

* During years we build up aa mental scratch book, what we like, what we follow, who is our hero
  * That influence is worth sharing
  * If you like something, don't hide it,don't think what others will think about it, be honest

## chapter 5

* Truth is, our work doesn't speak for it self. Stories you tell of your work, have a huge impact on how otherd value it

## chapter 6

> Make people better at something they want to be better

* Teach what you learnt - share references, reading list etc...
* Teaching doesn't substract value of what you do, it adds up
  * Generateore interest in your work
  * You receive education in return

## chapter 7

* Don't be too self centered. Real art comes in two way streets, feedback and collaboration is the way to goo. If you only show your work, then people would get sick
  * If you want fans, you have to be a fan first
  * If you want to be part of a community, first be a good citizen in the community
* Look for hearth not followers
  * Be an interesting person and connections would grow
  * Can you be a more interesting person?
  * Talk about things you a
* Meeting in IRal (in the real world) - meeting online is great, converting them into friends is even better

## chapter 8

* We have to be ready for the criticism
  * Relax, nobody died from criticism
  * Strength it, it's a way to improve, and roll with the punches, you can't control the source of criticism but you can control how you react. Having your work hated by certain people may be a badge of honor
  * Protect vulnerable areas, ifyou could not handle the criticism don't make it public
  * Keep your balance, you are not your work, criticism is about your work

> Not care about what everybody thinks, care about what the right people think

* Don't feed the troll, is not interested in improving your work, only in provoking
  * Make use of the block button and delete comment

## chapter 9

* Don't be shy to sell, most of the most amazing work has been possible thanks to money (people need to eat)
* Recollect emails even if you have nothing to sell right now

## chapter 10

* Work is never finished, just abandoned
  * Don't quit the show if you want to success, you need to stick
* Use your old projects to inspire new ones, what was missing? What could be done differently
* You need to fill up with inspiration for next works
  * During the commute -> doodle,read, write
  * Exercise -> relaxes our mind -> opens to new thoughts
  * Contact with nature -> disconnect from electronics
