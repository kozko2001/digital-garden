# Chapter 1

Bosses **guide** a **team** to achieve **results**

**Guidance**: or feedback -> often we don't give good guidance cause we don't know how the other will receive it (fear of being socially awkward, I am being to nice or too mean? )

**Team Building**: Figuring out right people for the right role (hiring, firing, promoting). And when the team is set... how to have them motivated.

**Results**:

> Relationship, and no power, drive you forward


Radical candor is based in two "sentences":
**Care personally**: Being more than a professional, to have good relationship you have to care as a human being not as a worker.
**Challenge directly**: Tell the team, when their work is not good enough


# Chapter 2 
![[radical_candor.png]]

- difference between **radical candor** and **obnoxious aggression** is:
	-  it's not mean, it's clear
	-  no belittle embarrass people in public
- Most people prefer a challenging jerk than a nice incompetent.
- How to start the wheel of feedback, start asking for feedback (give example) and when start giving it, start  by praising
- If a person is bold enough to give you feedback, do not critique their criticism
- people who are more concern for the** right answer**, instrad if **being right** are better bosses.
- Not personalize the feedback, instead of  "When they are not good enough" say "When their work is not good enough"

# Chapter 3

understand what motivates each person on your team

2 archetypes of persons:
- **Rock Star** (is rock solid)
	- stability, ambitious outside of work, content in life, happy in current role
- **Super Start**
	- change agent (cul inquiet), ambitious at work, want new opportunities

different type of learning:
- **step growth**: learning/deeping skills quickly
- **gradual growth**: mastered their work and making incremental improvements

> we all have periods when professionally we are in different growth stages

How to treat each archetype?
- **RockStart **
	- Need to recognize them, make them happy
	- but this doesn't mean *promotion*
		- which can set this person in roles is not well suited for
		- or simply don't want
- **SuperStar**
	- Challenge them!
	- make sure they are constantly learning
	- give them opportunities
		- even bigger that they can actually handle
	- ensure you are not too much dependent on them
		- cause they will fly eventually

- Sometimes a team change work... some times two persons don't work well together...
- When management is the only path to higher compensations, the quality of management suffers. Specially people under the umbrella of people who don't want this management role
- In many ways your job is to set and **hold**, a quality bar... seems harsh in the short term... but in the long term the only thing that is meaner is loweing the quality bar

# Chapter 4 
- Telling people what to do doesn't work -> people felt left out
- Jobs always get it right -> inviting you to challenge his ideas, so at the end, it was the best idea possible


1. **Listen**
	1.  Give the quite ones a voice
2. **Clarify**:
	1.  ideas are fragile at the beginning they need nurture.
	2. help making ideas drop dead easy for others to comprehend
3. **Debate**
	1. keep the conversation centered on the idea, not the ego
	2. Create the obligation to dissent
	3. don't grab a decision cause the debate is becoming painful
4. **Decide**
	1. Push decisions into the facts, or pull the facts into the decisions
	2. you are not the decider (usually)
	3. facts... not recommendations
5. **Persuade**:
	1. Listener's emotions, not speakers
	2. Credibility: demonstrate expertise and humility
	3. Logic: ensure everybody understand the facts that drive the decision
6. **Execute**
	1. keep dirt under your fingernails
	2. You should still do ground work
	3. So you understand your colleagues
	4. Block time to execute
7. **Learn**

# Chapter 5

- **work/life**, integration not balance: Your time and work time don't need to compete, instead they can help each other.
- **Calendar**: put things that you need to do yourself in the calendar
- **Free at work**: everybody is going to be able to bring their best, if they feel autonomous.
- **Building trust**: always takes times
- **Demonstrating openness**: When somebody shares something with you you should always be respectful
- **Recognize your own emotions**: share with the team how are you feeling
- **Ask questions**: when somebody is frustrated/angry etc... keep asking questions and listening, you will understand the real issue
- **Tell others how to feel: DON'T DO THAT **

# Chapter 6 

- **Guidance**: Is the key of being a boss, you need to get, give and encourage. bot praise and criticism.
- Is there anything I can do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?
- Don't critique the criticism, it's a gift, try to understand it, not debate it.
- critics => situation + behavior + impact
- Clarity of guidance gets measured in other person ear, not your moth
- Don't personalize: 
	-  ❌"You are wrong "
	-  ✅ "I think you are wrong"
- Make understand that when you critic/challenge you do it, because you care.
- Spend half the time looking backward, half planning (future)
