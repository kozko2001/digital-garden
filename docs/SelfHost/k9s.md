K9S
===


K9s is a terminal utility to control your kubernetes, in the past I have been using the kubernetes dashboard

but using k9s is a bit faster for some things, specially it allow you to get a shell and see the logs way faster


- you can use `/` to search in the list of items, so much like in `vim`
- you can use `:` to change the view, for example `:namespaces` show you all namespaces, you can select with `enter` and then see the pods there. or you can do `:deployments` and select the a deployment press `s` and to scale to a different number


In a nutshell is way more comfortable to use, if you are in the shell working with your yaml files and you don't need to use the mouse
